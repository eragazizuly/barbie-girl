        Collectors call the Turn N Twist Barbie TNT. She was the first of what later became known as the Mod Barbie Era from 1967 to 1973. The doll looks a little different because she has rooted eyelashes, long straight hair, bendable legs, and her waist can be turned, hence the name. The Twist N Turn Barbie was the most popular in the 1960s, according to Mattel. Both Barbie and Ken were released as astronauts in 1965, reflecting the enthusiasm in the U.S. around the space program. Mattel was on the right track. Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon four years later. A woman had already been in space though â€” Russian astronaut Valentina Tereshkova in 1963. Mattel reproduced the original doll astronauts in 2010.
